Spaceship, is a modern AAA tech demo, optimised for modern Macs by Unity & the Apple Metal Engineering Team. It's short 3-5 minute narrative sequence showcases high-end visual effects using Unity High Definition Render Pipeline & VFX Graph. It's primarily intended as a learning resource for game devs, but also tech enthusiasts!

The game is also available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1605230/Spaceship__Visual_Effect_Graph_Demo/)... but that build is very broken on Mac from the UI and gameplay interaction. Avoid it until it's fixed! 

## Mac Requirements

• MacBook Pro (M1) or later
• MacBook Air (M1) or later
• Mac mini (M1) or later
• Mac (M1) or later
• Mac Studio (M1 Max) or later
• Mac Pro (2023)

Note: Controller support is not fully available, and there are issues with mouse input in PLAY mode. So just use the benchmark mode.
