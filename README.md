Spaceship, is a modern AAA tech demo, optimised for Apple silicon-based Macs by Unity & the Apple Metal Engineering Team. It's short 3-5 minute narrative sequence showcases high-end visual effects using Unity High Definition Render Pipeline & VFX Graph. It's primarily intended as a learning resource for game devs, but also tech enthusiasts!

The game is also available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1605230/Spaceship__Visual_Effect_Graph_Demo/)... but that build is very broken on Mac from the UI and gameplay interaction. Avoid it until it's fixed!
